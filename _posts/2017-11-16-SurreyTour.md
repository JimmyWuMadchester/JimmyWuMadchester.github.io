Dear friends, 

I'm trying to take you to the beautiful Surrey countryside for a fantastic trip. You will be able to walk the most loved outdoor picnicking spot Box Hill, which appears in Jane Austen's Emma. I'm sure you don't want to miss a wine tasting tour at the Denbies wineyard, one of the largest wine producers. [I know although 'English wine' just doesn't sound right. :|] 

After a winter warming group Christmas lunch together at Denbies, we are heading to <The Adventure of the Reigate Squire> of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Besides a 12th century castle, we are going to take a walk around the lovely Reigate Priory Park, hunting for some winter's tale.

The final part is a tour of my lovely rented house with my landlady being away. :)

Best,
小伍

### Summary

Time: 10:30am, Saturday or Sunday, 9th/10th December 2017.

Location: Dorking Main station

Activities: trail walking/running/hiking, wine tasting, wineyard tour, ice skating, house warming

Node: Any pregnant women will be transported by car through out the day trip. 

### Getting to the start

Public transport becomes really bad on Sunday, one of the reason I'm planning it for a Saturday out. We will start from a car park not far from Box Hill. Maybe start from the car park around 10:30am? 

**Car:** National Trust Box Hill Stepping Stones Car Park RH5 6AE. Driving from Canary Wharf is about 1h23min via M25. If you arrive early, you can wait for others in the car park.

**Train** You can buy return tickets from London Waterloo (£11.5 offpeak) or London Victoria (£9 offpeak) to Dorking Main station. The journey takes between 50-60mins. It takes 15mins to walk from station to the car park. The (Route Any Permitted) return ticket will cover your journey later to Reigate and going back to London from there.

### Walking to the Box Hill Cafe

Through the stepping stones path, it takes another 20mins walking up to the top of Box Hill. Enjoy the top view :)

### Denbies Wine Estate

Walk downhill 35mins to nearby Denbies Wine Estate. Indoor wine tasting and Christmas lunch.

I've called them, and they have confirmed they will be able to cater us on 9th December lunch time. They have some bookable wine tasting activities as well as other tours. I'm open to suggestions on this. Their website is [http://www.denbies.co.uk/](http://www.denbies.co.uk/).

### Reigate

Walk 20mins to Dorking Deepdene station, then another 10mins train to Reigate station. There are bus services going to Reigate as well but takes longer. 

Walk from Reigate station to Priory Park via castle ground and high street. They have an ice rink in the park if you fance ice skating. For the keen athletics, bring your trail running shoes! Fantastic trails in the park and nearby.

### Yulin's Place

Another 30mins walk or 5mins taxi to my place for dinner and drinks. Again open for suggestions on food. Otherwise, I'll get some pizzas and take aways. I don't trust my cooking at all! We should be able to make it to my place around 4pm. 

### Going back to London

It might take longer than you expect. Southern trains are in general sluggish during weekends, and there will be planned engineering work during that weekends. In the worst case, you should be able to get to Gatwick Airport and going back to London from there.
