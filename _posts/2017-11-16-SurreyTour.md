Dear friends, 

I'm trying to take you to the beautiful Surrey countryside for a fantastic trip. You will be able to walk the most loved outdoor picknicking spot Box Hill, which appears in Jane Austen's Emma. I'm sure you don't want to miss a wine tasting tour at the Denbies wineyard, one of the largest wine producers. [I know although 'English wine' just doesn't sound right. :|] 

After a winter warming group Christmas lunch together at Denbies, we are heading to <The Adventure of the Reigate Squire> of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Besides a 12th century castle, we are going to take a walk around the lovely Reigate Priory Park, hunting for some winter's tale.

The final part is a tour of my lovely rented house with my landlady being away. :)

Best,
小伍
