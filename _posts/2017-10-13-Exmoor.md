## Weather and Climate

Statistics from [meteoblue](https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/forecast/modelclimate/exmoor-national-park_united-kingdom_2649801)

I won't be able to promise on this! October isn't the best time for clear skies. From the statistics, it's expected to have 15 overcast days in October.

Temperature wise, during the day it's between 6 to 13 degree. In a cold night, it could reach 0 in October. I would expect it being a bit windy along the coast. So runners are recommended to take a waterproof jacket with you. Better to keep warm when running along the beautiful coast.

## Camping and Accommodation

Again, I need to stress the weather here. If it starts raining heavily, it would be quite misserable for camping. The stats show 15.6 dry days in October. So it would be dry for half of the time hopefully. We really need to wait and see until the week before this trip.

Camping Kits:

1. Tent. A would recommend teamming up with another person for setting up a two-man tent. It just saves a lot of time for hard work.
1. Sleeping bag. At least to carry a 3 Season sleeping bag, which handles temperature from 0 or above.
1. Sleeping Mat. To keep the comfort and the moisture out.

I don't really see us cooking there. It just feels too much efforts. So we need to look up for places where we can get food and dinner etc.

If anyone feels camping is not for them, there are accommodations available nearby. I would strongly suggest stay under a roof when it's forecasted to rain hard.
